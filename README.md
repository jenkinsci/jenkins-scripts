# jenkins-scripts

This is a collection of utility scripts for use with
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org), the leading continuous integration
server.

They can cover a range of use cases - automating Jenkins management,
end-user tools, etc. They're organized by function 

- [Scriptler](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Scriptler+Plugin)
scripts, for use in the Jenkins Plugin, are in the "scriptler"
directory and should follow the convention as described in [scriptler README.md](scriptler/README.md)
- and other scripts are in the "managed-scripts" directory,
and then organized by scripting language.
